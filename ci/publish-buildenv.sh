# The toolchain is a local dependency, not a build product: this script stages
# whatever the developer machine has ($CLD_DIR + $FLUTTER_DIR) into a context and
# bakes it. That is deliberate — the HarmonyOS SDK is behind a Huawei developer
# login, so it cannot be fetched on a runner, and the whole point of the image is
# to move that one download off CI and onto a machine that already has it.
#
# Staging hard-links rather than copies, so it costs no disk on the common case
# of the sources and the stage dir sharing a filesystem; it falls back to a real
# copy when they do not.
#
# The image tag is derived from the two toolchain versions, never hand-written:
# a tag that says what is inside it is the only way to tell two builds of this
# image apart, and `latest` would let CI drift from the toolchain it was tested
# against. After pushing, point `container.image` in
# .github/workflows/ohos-release.yml at the printed tag.

Publish complete. Point the OHOS release job at it:

  .github/workflows/ohos-release.yml ->  container.image: $IMAGE:$tag

Verify the image on this machine first — a release runner has no room for a
toolchain that does not work. These are the two commands the workflow runs, in
an empty container, against a bind-mounted checkout:

  docker run --rm -v "\$PWD:/workspace/techpie" -w /workspace/techpie $IMAGE:$tag \\
    bash -c 'flutter pub get && scripts/build-unsigned-hap.sh'

Local docker cache now holds the untrimmed staging layer (~9.7 GB) as well;
'docker system prune' reclaims it once the image is pushed.
