/// The scanner's viewfinder, reproduced from Telegram's `CameraScanActivity`.
///
/// Three animated scalars drive it:
///
/// * [appearing] — a spring started when the preview is ready. The box grows
///   from half size while the four brackets retract into short rounded ticks.
/// * [dismissed] — fades only the title, hint, and controls after recognition.
/// * [absorbed] — a spring that morphs the box onto the decoded code corners.
///
/// The scrim's opening is rounded to the same radius as the corner marks'
/// outer edge, so the dimmed area and the brackets read as one frame. The
/// startup cover is the page's, because it has to sit above the chrome too.
///
/// The numbers are the ones in Telegram's source: `lineLength` eases with
/// `pow(v, 1.8)`, the stroke reaches 4dp within 5% of the appearing spring, the
/// resting square is `min(w, h) / 1.5`, and the found-code target is padded
/// 25dp horizontally and 15dp vertically.
